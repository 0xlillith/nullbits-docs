# Rotary Encoder Install Guide
If you purchased the [Nullbits Rotary Encoder and Knob pack](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NH53BMJ), follow this guide to install it on your device.

## Required Components
1. 1x Rotary Encoder
2. 1x Knob
3. 1x 6-32 Set Screw (usually screwed into the knob)
4. 1x Allen wrench (you'll have to figure out the appropriate size)

## Instructions
1. Align and insert the rotary encoder into the appropriate sockets for your device. Refer to the build guide for your device for pictures - [Nibble](https://github.com/nullbitsco/docs/blob/main/nibble/build_guide_en.md), [Tidbit](https://github.com/nullbitsco/docs/blob/main/tidbit/build_guide_en.md).
2. Solder the small pins of the rotary encoder. Do not solder or clip the large pins.
3. If building with plate, install hotswap sockets, plate and switches before proceeding.
4. Align the knob such that the screw faces the flat side of the rotary encoder stem.
5. Push the knob onto the rotary encoder stem and tighten the screw with an allen wrench.
