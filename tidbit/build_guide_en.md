# Assembly Steps

⚠️ **Important!** Notes marked with this icon are crucial, so be sure to read them carefully before moving on.

Steps marked [OPTIONAL] aren&#39;t required for the base kit, but may be needed depending on what you choose to include in your build.

  1.
## [optional] Solder underglow LEDS

Solder the 8x WS2812B underglow LEDs. Start by tacking down one corner, and then soldering the remaining 3 leads. After soldering, clean with rubbing alcohol.

⚠️ **Orientation matters!** These parts have a small angled mark which should match up with the one on the PCB. If you don&#39;t get the orientation right, the LEDs will not work, and your keyboard may not boot up.

  1.
## Solder reset switch

Fit and solder the reset switch as shown below.

| ![](RackMultipart20210210-4-ko0kxb_html_afbcddce7a095032.gif) ![](RackMultipart20210210-4-ko0kxb_html_f1d2dddde68db221.jpg) |

After soldering, clean with rubbing alcohol.

  1.
## Bend and solder diodes

Bend and fit the 1N4148 diodes. In order to get uniform placement of the diodes, I recommend using a diode bending tool. You can buy one or 3D print one. [Here&#39;s a link to my favorite](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4332520). Bend the leads inward to hold the diodes in place when the PCB is turned upside down. Begin by soldering one side of the diodes and adjust the diode alignment to your liking before soldering the second lead.

⚠️ **Orientation matters!** Solder the diodes with the black bar **UP** as shown in the images. The keyboard will not work if they are backward.

| ![](RackMultipart20210210-4-ko0kxb_html_8f64a2d001851739.jpg) | ![](RackMultipart20210210-4-ko0kxb_html_41b14b55a818c4ed.jpg) |
| --- | --- |

After soldering all diodes, clean with rubbing alcohol and use the snips to clip the leads as close to the PCB as possible.

  1.
## [optional] Solder TRRS expansion jack

Fit and solder the 4-pin TRRS expansion jack as shown below. After soldering, clean with rubbing alcohol and use the snips to clip the pins as close to the PCB as possible.

![](RackMultipart20210210-4-ko0kxb_html_380d098b5e7a285d.gif) ![](RackMultipart20210210-4-ko0kxb_html_ac05f778bfe7492e.jpg)

  1.
## Solder MCU

Fit and solder the BIT-C or Pro Micro MCU as shown below. After soldering, clean with rubbing alcohol and use the snips to clip the pins as close to the PCB as possible.

![](RackMultipart20210210-4-ko0kxb_html_abab216e469ae1b0.jpg)

  1.
## [optional] solder rotary encoder, led matrix, and/or oled

If building with the optional rotary encoder, alphanumeric display or LED matrix, or OLED display in place of the programmable macro keys, fit and solder each in the position each shown. After soldering, clean with rubbing alcohol and use the snips to clip the pins as close to the PCB as possible. **Do not clip the large support pins on the encoder.**

![](RackMultipart20210210-4-ko0kxb_html_ca62ca7f989b36f7.png)

⚠️ **Compatibility note:** the top-left and top-right encoder (encoder 1) footprints share the same signals. An encoder should only be installed in one of the footprints.

⚠️ **Compatibility note:** encoder 3 shares the drive signals with the I2C bus. It can not be used at the same time as the OLED, alphanumeric display, or LED matrix options.

⚠️ **Compatibility note:** encoder 4 shares the drive signals with the UART bus. It can not be used at the same time as the expansion port.

**Placement guide (see image below):**

**SSD1306 OLED Display**

**Mini 8x8 LED Matrix**

**1.2&quot; 16x8 LED Matrix**

**Quad Alphanumeric Display**

⚠️

# **STOP!**

It&#39;s highly recommended that you test each key at this point before continuing. Jump to step 16 to flash QMK firmware. Use a keyboard tester ([this one](https://www.keyboardtester.com/) works) and short the switch pads for each switch using tweezers, a clipped lead from earlier, or something else conductive. If there is an issue, it will be much easier to debug now before everything has been soldered and assembled.

  1.
## [optional] Insert hot-swap sockets

If building with hotswap sockets, drop one into each plated lead hole. Alternatively, insert them onto each lead of the PCB mount switch before proceeding.

  1.
## Snap in switches

⚠️ **Stop!** Test fit your keycaps to make sure that the switch spacings are correct before soldering, especially the bottom row.

The switches will take some force to insert. This is by design. The TIDBIT doesn&#39;t have a plate mount, so the tight fit makes in the PCB the switches more stable. Snap in by supporting the back of the PCB, and then pushing hard on the top of the switch. It helps to use a spare keycap on the switch to take some of the pressure off your thumb. After snapping the switch in, make sure it&#39;s sitting flush against the PCB.

![](RackMultipart20210210-4-ko0kxb_html_6fbe29b2eee1b271.jpg)

  1.
## Solder switches or hot-swap sockets

Make sure each switch pin has enough solder to form a nice solid joint.

  1.
## Screw together M2x3 standoffs using M2x3 screws

In the locations shown, screw the M2x3 standoffs into the **TOP** PCB plate. Fasten using 6 M2x3 screws. Use pliers to hold the standoff steady while tightening the screw. **Do not overtighten!**

![](RackMultipart20210210-4-ko0kxb_html_6f121cb6d989458a.gif) ![](RackMultipart20210210-4-ko0kxb_html_6f121cb6d989458a.gif) ![](RackMultipart20210210-4-ko0kxb_html_6f121cb6d989458a.gif) ![](RackMultipart20210210-4-ko0kxb_html_6f121cb6d989458a.gif) ![](RackMultipart20210210-4-ko0kxb_html_c7b64e8fc4a2814f.gif) ![](RackMultipart20210210-4-ko0kxb_html_6f121cb6d989458a.gif) ![](RackMultipart20210210-4-ko0kxb_html_d7d08422204b2737.jpg)

  1.
## Slide the acrylic spacer onto the standoffs

Make sure the acrylic spacer sits flat against the PCB plate. Check for interreferences due to leads or solder joints. Trim if needed.

![](RackMultipart20210210-4-ko0kxb_html_1cf47861aff6334b.jpg)

  1.
## Fasten the bottom with M2x3 screws

Place the bottom PCB plate on top of the acrylic spacer. In the same locations where the 13 standoffs were installed, fasten with 13 M2x3 screws. **Do not overtighten!**

![](RackMultipart20210210-4-ko0kxb_html_3f16bf66206eb6f5.gif) ![](RackMultipart20210210-4-ko0kxb_html_3f16bf66206eb6f5.gif) ![](RackMultipart20210210-4-ko0kxb_html_3f16bf66206eb6f5.gif) ![](RackMultipart20210210-4-ko0kxb_html_3f16bf66206eb6f5.gif) ![](RackMultipart20210210-4-ko0kxb_html_3f16bf66206eb6f5.gif) ![](RackMultipart20210210-4-ko0kxb_html_3f16bf66206eb6f5.gif) ![](RackMultipart20210210-4-ko0kxb_html_7d9a9a7e69bc7f95.jpg)

![](RackMultipart20210210-4-ko0kxb_html_3f16bf66206eb6f5.gif) ![](RackMultipart20210210-4-ko0kxb_html_3f16bf66206eb6f5.gif)Fasten using 2 M2x6 screws. Don&#39;t overtighten these, as it can crack the top guard.

![](RackMultipart20210210-4-ko0kxb_html_a14047121bfec5b5.jpg)

  1.
## Flash firmware using QMK toolbox

Download either a precompiled binary (only if using a Pro Micro or BIT-C) or the QMK source files from [GitHub](https://github.com/nullbitsco/nibble). Using [QMK Toolbox](https://qmk.fm/toolbox/), flash the firmware onto the keyboard.
